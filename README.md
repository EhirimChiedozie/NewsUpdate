The aim of this work is to get news update from a Nigerian news site "dailypost.ng". 
When the code is run, it creates a text file "DailyPost.txt" in the same directory as your code file.
Since the contents of the website are regularly updated, the code works in such a way that every 2 hours, new items are added to the text file.
This work was done with the python's requests and bs4 libraries.
